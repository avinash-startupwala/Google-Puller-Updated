# Google-Puller-Updated

this project is more OOP way..

each and every class is dedicated to specific and related task and not one class is handling
unrelated things

for example:
I have introduced three new classes:
       class HtmlParser : handling only parsing of html
       class ShowJsonData: handling only Json related thinhs
       class AccessDatabase: handling only inserting and reading of data
